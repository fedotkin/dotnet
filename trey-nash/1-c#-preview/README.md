## About
Chapter 1, "C# Preview,"[^1] gives a quick glimpse of what a simple C# application looks like, and it
describes some basic differences between the C# programming environment and the native C++ 
environment.

## Abstract
This is a book for experienced object-oriented developers; therefore, I assume that you already have 
some familiarity with the .NET runtime. _Essential .NET Volume 1: The Common Language Runtime_ by 
Don Box (Boston, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2002)[^2] is an excellent book specifically covering the .NET 
runtime. Additionally, it’s important to look at some of the similarities and differences between C# and 
C++, and then go through an elementary “Hello World!” example for good measure. If you already have 
experience building .NET applications, you may want to skip this chapter. However, you may want to 
read the section “Overview of New C# 4.0 Features.”
