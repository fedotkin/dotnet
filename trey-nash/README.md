**Amazon.com Book** : [Trey Nash. Accelerated C# 2010](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerated-2010-Experts-Voice-Trey/dp/1430225378)

> C# 2010 offers powerful new features, and this book is the fastest path to mastering them―and the rest of C#―for both experienced C# programmers moving to C# 2010 and programmers moving to C# from another object-oriented language. Many books introduce C#, but very few also explain how to use it optimally with the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR). This book teaches both core C# language concepts and how to wisely employ C# idioms and object-oriented design patterns to exploit the power of C# and the CLR.
>
> This book is both a rapid tutorial and a permanent reference. You'll quickly master C# syntax while learning how the CLR simplifies many programming tasks. You’ll also learn best practices that ensure your code will be efficient, reusable, and robust. Why spend months or years discovering the best ways to design and code C# when this book will show you how to do things the right way from the start?
>
> - Comprehensively and concisely explains both C# 2008 and C# 2010 features
> - Focuses on the language itself and on how to use C# 2010 proficiently for all .NET application development
> - Concentrates on how C# features work and how to best use them for robust, high-performance code
