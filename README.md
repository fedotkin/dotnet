Learning laboratory for .NET Framework and C# language. Researches, books, coding challenges, small projects.


## .NET and .NET Framework[^1]
[.NET is a developer platform](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet) made up of [tools](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/tools), [programming languages](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages), and libraries for building many different types of applications.

There are various implementations of .NET. Each implementation allows .NET code to execute in different places â€” Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and many more.

1. **.NET Framework** is the original implementation of .NET. It supports running websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows.
2. **.NET** is a cross-platform implementation for running websites, services, and console apps on Windows, Linux, and macOS. [.NET is open source](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/open-source) on GitHub. .NET was previously called .NET Core.
3. [**Xamarin/Mono**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/xamarin/what-is-xamarin) is a .NET implementation for running apps on all the major mobile operating systems, including iOS and Android.

## A tour of the C# language[^2][^3]
C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 11 and earlier. If you want to explore the language through interactive examples, try the [introduction to C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/) tutorials.

C# is an object-oriented, ***component-oriented*** programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an ***object-oriented*** language. You define types and their behavior.

Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. [***Garbage collection***](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/) automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects. [***Nullable type***](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references) guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects. [***Exception handling***](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/exceptions/) provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery. [***Lambda expressions***](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions) support functional programming techniques. [***Language Integrated Query (LINQ)***](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source. Language support for [***asynchronous operations***](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/) provides syntax for building distributed systems. C# has a [***unified type system***](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/). All C# types, including primitive types such as ```int``` and ```double```, inherit from a single root ```object``` type. All types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined [reference types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/reference-types) and [value types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-types). C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance. C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.
